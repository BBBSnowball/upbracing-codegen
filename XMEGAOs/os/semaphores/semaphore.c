//NOTE(Benjamin): It is very good that you write documentation for your functions. However, I think that it should be in the
//                header file, as other programmers won't look at the c file, when they want to learn about the interface. Of
//                course, you can describe the details of your implementation in the c file.

//NOTE(Benjamin): Your comments look like they are meant to be processed by some automatic system similar to JavaDoc. It looks
//                like Doxygen, but for that you have to start your comments with two stars instead of one, so Doxygen will
//                know that they are special.
//                see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html#specialblock

//NOTE(Benjamin): Your function signatures are wrong. Please make sure that you copy them from the header file. Otherwise, the
//                program will crash. You have to use a pointer because only then can you change the variable.

//NOTE(Benjamin): I get the impression that there are quite a few bugs in your implementation. We aren't the first ones who
//                implement semaphores. Please look at pseudo code in books or at existing implementations! That way you will
//                not only save yourself a lot of work, but we will also have fewer bugs.

//NOTE(Benjamin): The parameter "name" contains the semaphore. On the macro, this parameter name makes sense. For the functions, you
//                should consider calling it "sem" or something similar, as it contains a pointer to the semaphore and not its name.
//                Please update the documentation accordingly.
