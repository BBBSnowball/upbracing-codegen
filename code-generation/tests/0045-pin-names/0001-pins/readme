What this test folder contains?
There are two tests subfolders : The Compasskeyboard test folder and PORTA test folder. Each of these test folders conatins tests
to be run independently over the microcontroller with serial line communication with the PC.

What the test subfolders PORTA and Compasskeyboard contain?
- main.c to be loaded onto the board. 
- the java file that runs on the PC.
- the .sch file that contains the necessary schematics for the specific test. 

What we test?
We will be testing the macros in the Pins.h header file over the alias names defined for the pins in the config.rb file
in each of these tests. 

In PORTA test we are just interested in the wires connected to the PORTA pins and testing whether the
alias names given to these wires work well for all the macros. But since the PORTA is connected to the LEDs, we cannot test
the INPUT macro for PORTA. 

In the Compasskeyboad test we are interested in the wires connected to ports PORTE.2, PORTE.4 to PORTE.7 and PORTD.1. These ports
are connected to the compass card keyboard on the DVK90CAN1 board. We cannot test OUTPUT macro for this test.

What is needed for testing?
Both of these tests are meant to be run on DVK90CAN1 board and a windows, Linux, or Mac OS PC.

How to run the tests?
Run the appropriate rake script for the platform by specifying the name of the project and the Debug/Release or no extension.
For example run the command rake-Windows.bat build-pin-names-pins-PORTA-Debug(Release) for PORTA for running the tests over 
windows.

Once the MCU is loaded with the tests you might be asked to perform some tasks. The instructions would be shown over the console, 
and you must answer some questions related to the tests. In some tests, the ones that are automated, you wouldn't be required to do
so.
