This test tries to break nested critical sections.

One task enters an outer critical section and then an inner critical section, 
fetches a global variable from memory, waits some time and then saves it back.
It then leaves the inner critical section and fetches, waits and saves back another variable.
It then leaves the outer critical section and fetches, waits and saves back a third variable.

Meanwhile another interfering task tries to modify the values of all three variables.

The test is successful if the interfering task can not change the value of the first two variables,
but does change the value of the third variable.
