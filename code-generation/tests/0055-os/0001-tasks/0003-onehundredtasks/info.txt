This test used to be for testing 100 tasks as an extreme case, but proved to be impossible with our current hardware (AT90CAN128).
Every task needs its own stack space and the 4KB of memory are insufficient for 100 tasks.
The program compiles without problems, but the processor resets immediately after the OS is started.
