How to setup our projects on Windows

1. install JDK (Java Development Kit; JRE is not enough!)
2. install Eclipse with GMF and Eugenia (Software\Eclipse)
3. add AVR-Eclipse plugin (eclipse-plugins-3rdPart.zip)
4. import most projects in the code-generation folder
   java-parser-tools
   StatechartEditor
   StatechartEditorFeature
   StatechartEditor.diagram
   tests
   tests-java-helpers
   upbracing-AVR-CodeGenerator
   (upbracing-AVR-TimerConfigurationEditor)
   (upbracing-AVR-TimerConfigurationFeature)
   upbracing-AVR-TimerConfigurationModel
5. reset code-generation/upbracing-AVR-CodeGenerator/.jetproperties
   to the version in GIT because Eclipse messes it up, when you
   import the project
   run: git checkout code-generation/upbracing-AVR-CodeGenerator/.jetproperties
   You need to update the project in Eclipse.
6. delete the folder 'de' inside upbracing-AVR-CodeGenerator
   (created because of wrong .jetproperties file)
7. build project upbracing-AVRTimerConfigurationModel
   If it cannot find the Java compiler, please make sure that Eclipse uses
   a JDK and not JRE.
   NOTE: If the file 'de.upbracing.timer.configurationmodel.jar' exists in the
         'dist' folder (and is up to date), you can skip steps 7 and 8.
8. Refresh the project. There should be the folder 'dist' with a JAR file.
   If this file doesn't exist, you need to fix the project setup and repeat
   step 7. The project is using an external ANT builder. You can also run
   ANT manually to build the file.
9. open StatechartEditor/metamodel and run "Eugenia -> Generate GMF editor"
   in the context menu (right click) of statecharts.emf
10. You may have to run "Build project" on StatechartEditor to get rid
    of the error messages.
11. If you want multi-line text fields in the statecharts editor, you
    must make sure that it uses a few modified files. You can find them in
    the GIT, but we don't care for now.
9. The other projects should be fine now. All projects should build
   without errors.
10. Create code-generation/tests/userconfig.rb using the example file
11. Import caRTOS project (in folder caRTOS/XMEGAOs/os)
12. Build caRTOS (XMegaOs) project. Please built all configurations (Debug and Release).
13. Make sure all the important tools are in the PATH environment variable:
    - WinAVR: 'bin' and 'utils\bin'
    - JDK: 'bin' folder with java.exe and javac.exe
    - Eagle Version 5: 'bin' folder
    You should be able to run the following tools from the command line:
    - java -version
    - javac -version
    - avr-gcc
    - md5sum
    - eagle
14. open a terminal
 a) change to the code-generation/tests folder
 b) run rake-Windows.bat to build all test projects
 c) attach programmer, test board and serial adapter
 d) run all tests: rake-Windows.bat test-all
