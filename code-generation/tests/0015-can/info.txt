This test tests the code generators to generate the CAN sending and receiving methods.

You need two test boards with AT90CAN to test it. Both boards need to be flashed with the same file.
The first board is leading the test. It is connected with RS232 with the PC to verify the test outcomes.
The second board is attached with a can connection to the first board.
It must be powered on before the first board is starting the CAN test.
