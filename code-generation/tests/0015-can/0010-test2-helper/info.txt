This helper can be instructed to send messages and it relays received
messages. It must be programmed on a board that is connected to the
DUT via CAN before running test2-dut.

It receives instructions (messages to send) with message identifier
CAN_INSTRUCTION_ID (usually 0x1371, extended identifiers):
1st message: 0x00, ID1, ID2, ID3, ID4, DLC, DATA1, DATA2
2nd message: 0x01, DATA3 .. DATA8, 0x00
You have to always send both messages (even if DLC<=2). The first
message must be the first that is received and there mustn't be any
other instruction messages between those two. The second message
triggers sending the message.
If the highest bit of the ID (bit 7 of ID4) is 1, an extended frame
will be sent. If the second to highest bit (bit 6 of ID4) is 1, a
remote frame will be sent.

It relays received messages (except instructions) to CAN_RELAY_ID
(usually 0x1372, extended identifiers):
Message format is the same as for instructions. Unused data bytes
might contain data of previous messages, so don't expect them to
be 0x00.
