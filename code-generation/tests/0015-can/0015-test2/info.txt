Test most features of our CAN communication code generator. It uses a
slave board that relays received messages and can be instructed to send
messages, as well (see 0010-test2-helper).

The master board (the board we run our test software on) is connected to
the PC via the serial line. It forwards instructions to the slave board
and at the same time, it runs the test software.

This helper can be instructed to send messages and it relays received
messages. It must be programmed on a board that is connected to the
DUT via CAN before running test2-dut.
