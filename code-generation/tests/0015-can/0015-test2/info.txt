Test most features of our CAN communication code generator. It uses a
slave board that relays received messages and can be instructed to send
messages, as well (see 0010-test2-helper).

The master board (the board we run our test software on) is connected to
the PC via the serial line. It forwards instructions to the slave board
and at the same time, it runs the test software.

The DBC file contains some messages that test certain aspects, e.g.
empty messages, order of signals, undefined parts. The messages can
be sent and received by the MCU. Sending is done with the general
transmitter for most messages, but we also use dedicated and shared MObs
for some. Most MObs are used for reception. Again, we have dedicated and
shared MObs.

Test A: Send a few instances of each message
Test B: Receive messages and report the value of the corresponding variables

TODO: Test extended messages and mixed standard/extended MObs.
